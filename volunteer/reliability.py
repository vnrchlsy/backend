"""US-V5 · the volunteer reliability signal — derived, never stored.

No counter column exists and none should be added (consistent with §6.7's
consecutive-withdrawal rule and the existing "derived from the no_show count" wording).

⚠️ D-S5-2 — aggregate only, in BOTH directions. This returns three integers and two
booleans and nothing else: never which shelters, never dates, never a per-org breakdown.
The count is global across Kupkop; the decision to approve stays each shelter's. The
volunteer sees the same numbers on their own history.
