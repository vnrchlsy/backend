"""US-F0 / US-N2 / US-V7 · invoke every scheduled sweep once.

    python manage.py run_sweeps

One command, one cron entry, however many domains own sweeps. Sweeps were multiplying
across apps (sagip's three, now volunteer's reminders) and a per-app command would mean a
per-app cron line to forget. No scheduler is embedded here — US-F0's decision (cron over
Celery-beat) still stands, and D-S5-6 reconfirmed it for push.

⚠️ `purge_expired_documents` (US-SEC4) stays its own command deliberately: retention
deletion is destructive and should be schedulable — and auditable — independently of the
routine hourly sweeps.
