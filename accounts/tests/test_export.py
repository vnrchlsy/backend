"""US-N3 · GET /me/export — RA 10173 portability (§12.6, §12.7).

D-S7-2: one synchronous, authenticated, throttled JSON response. No email delivery and no
async job — there is no Celery (US-F0 chose cron/commands over a broker), and standing up a
job queue for portability in the launch sprint is the wrong trade. The regulation asks for
machine-readable and timely, not asynchronous.

⚠️ **The export is the single widest authenticated read in the app**, which makes it the
easiest place to leak someone else. Two invariants carry that weight, and both are asserted
below rather than assumed:

  1. It contains only rows this account authored or owns — a shared row (an inquiry, a
     pledge) exports the caller's side, never the counterparty's contact details.
  2. §12.5's coarsening is NOT bypassed just because the caller is exporting. Precise
     coordinates appear only for reports the caller filed themselves.
