    rule (US-SEC1/§12.5) the API otherwise enforces — the photo would leak what the JSON
    response deliberately withholds. Runs on every image purpose; a PDF (the one
    `verification_doc` content type with no EXIF concept) passes through unchanged.

    Re-encodes via Pillow (dropping the source `info`/exif dict entirely) rather than
    surgically deleting individual EXIF tags — simpler, and correct here since nothing
    downstream depends on any other embedded metadata (ICC profile, XMP, …) surviving.

    This is the transform a post-upload worker/Lambda calls once a real bucket exists
    (US-D2's "buildable slice without live AWS credentials") — wiring the S3 event
    trigger itself is the deploy-time task, not this function.
