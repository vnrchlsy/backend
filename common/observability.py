"""US-E2 · structured logging, request correlation, and the Sentry seam (§16.5).

§16.5 asks for CloudWatch-shaped JSON logs, Sentry for errors, and enough correlation to
follow one request. None of it existed: `common/analytics.py::emit` has written JSON lines
since Sprint 6 with **no `LOGGING` config to route them**, so every §17.2 analytics event was
going to Django's default handler and, in a deployed process, nowhere useful.

⚠️ SCRUBBING IS THE POINT OF THIS MODULE, not a detail of it.

Observability is the one system whose entire job is to copy production data somewhere else.
An error tracker captures request bodies, headers and local variables by default. Enabling it
without redaction would put bearer tokens in a third-party dashboard (account takeover from a
support ticket), send a stray report's **precise coordinates** to a service that §12.5 spends
the rest of the codebase keeping them away from, and hand emails and phone numbers to a
processor the RA 10173 privacy notice never named.

A breach caused by our own logging is an avoidable §12.6 incident. So everything that leaves
this process goes through `scrub()` first — the Sentry hook AND the log formatter, because
"we only log safe things" is a claim no reviewer can verify about every future log call.
