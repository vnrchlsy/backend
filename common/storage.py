"""Media signing/upload seam — US-R3 (signed GET) + US-D2 (real presigned upload).

**Two buckets, by visibility** (US-D2): `MEDIA_S3_BUCKET_PUBLIC` (pet/listing/report
photos, avatars — CDN-cacheable, world-readable) and `MEDIA_S3_BUCKET_RESTRICTED`
(verification docs — gov ID, proof of billing — no public read, ever; reached only via
`signed_get_url`, TTL ≤ 5 min, minted fresh per page render). Every render/upload path
goes through this module, so the day real buckets are configured only this file changes —
nothing elsewhere ever builds or emits a raw S3 object URL itself.

**Still a dev stub with no bucket configured** — the same pattern the OTP sender and
social-auth seam use: `POST /media/presign` returns `https://example.invalid/...`
placeholders, `signed_get_url` returns the stored reference unchanged, `delete_object` is
a no-op. Wiring an actual bucket (env vars, IAM, lifecycle rules) stays a deploy-time task
for whoever has AWS access — this module's job is that the *code path* is real and tested
against a mocked S3 (`moto`), not that a bucket is live.
