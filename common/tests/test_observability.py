"""US-E2 · logging, request correlation, and the Sentry seam (§16.5).

§16.5 asks for structured JSON logs, error tracking, and request correlation. None of it was
configured: `common/analytics.py::emit` has been writing JSON lines since Sprint 6 with **no
`LOGGING` block to route them anywhere**, and there was no way to tie a user's error report
to the lines that produced it.

⚠️ THE PART THAT MATTERS MOST IS THE SCRUBBING, and it is why this file is mostly about
redaction rather than plumbing. Observability is the one system whose entire job is to copy
production data somewhere else — an error tracker holds request bodies, headers and local
variables by default. Shipping it unscrubbed would mean:

  * bearer tokens in a third-party dashboard, i.e. account takeover from a support ticket;
  * a stray report's **precise coordinates** leaving the system that deliberately withholds
    them from strangers (§12.5), through the back door;
  * emails and phone numbers in a service the RA 10173 privacy notice never mentions.

A breach notification caused by our own logging is an avoidable §12.6 incident, so the
redaction is asserted here rather than trusted.
