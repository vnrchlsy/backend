# US-SEC2 · abuse throttles on the public surface. Login/forgot-password get TWO
# throttles each — one per-IP, one per-identifier — because either alone has a hole: an
# attacker rotating IPs still hammers one target account under IP-only throttling, and
# an attacker with one IP but many candidate accounts (credential stuffing) sails past
# per-identifier throttling. Both apply; whichever trips first blocks the request.
#
# ⚠️ Enumeration asymmetry stays intact by construction (§12.1): the throttle key is the
# raw submitted string, never a DB lookup — an existing and a non-existing identifier are
# indistinguishable to the throttle, so the 429 (and its retry-after) is identical either
# way. Nothing here queries the database before deciding whether to throttle.
