"""US-Q2 · the load check for §13.1's latency budgets.

    DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost/kupkop_load \
    DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=... DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=testserver \
    python dev/load_check.py --seed --scale year1
    ... --measure --scale year1

⚠️ WHERE THIS RUNS, STATED UP FRONT. There is no staging environment (US-D3's standing
finding). This runs against local Postgres on a developer laptop, with production-SHAPED
data — right tables, right cardinality, right spatial distribution — but not production
hardware, not production concurrency, and not across a network. A number labelled
"staging" that came from a laptop is worse than no number, so this script labels itself.

WHAT IS AND IS NOT MEASURED
  Measured: URL routing, middleware, DRF, permissions, serialization, and every SQL
    round trip — i.e. the part of the latency budget the code controls, on a warm cache.
  Not measured: TLS, the ALB, the network, gunicorn's worker model, connection-pool
    contention, and any concurrency at all. Requests here are issued sequentially, so
    these are best-case latencies. Real p95 under load will be HIGHER, never lower.
  Consequence: a scenario that passes here is not proven to pass in production, but a
    scenario that FAILS here fails in production too. Treat green as "not disproven"
    and red as conclusive.

Settings run with DEBUG OFF on purpose. Under DEBUG, Django accumulates every query in
`connection.queries` for the life of the process — which both distorts the timings and
turns a 50k-row seed into a memory problem. The seed step turns it on deliberately for
its own query capture and says so.
