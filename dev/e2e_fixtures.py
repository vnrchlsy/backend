"""Create or refresh the throwaway accounts the Maestro suite signs in with.

The E2E README says the flows use "a throwaway account on a dev/staging backend, created by
the developer running this". Until now that creation was a sequence of commands somebody
typed once, which is not a setup anyone else can reproduce — and reproducing it is the whole
point of the suite.

Run it, then eval what it prints:

    python dev/e2e_fixtures.py            # create/refresh, print the exports
    eval "$(python dev/e2e_fixtures.py)"  # ...straight into the environment

⚠️ WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY REFUSES TO DO
  · run outside DEBUG — these are accounts with known passwords;
  · touch any address that is not `.invalid` (RFC 2606: permanently unresolvable, so the
    address can never collide with a real person's and can never receive mail);
  · reuse a password — every run generates new ones, so a leaked value expires by itself.

⚠️ THE ACCOUNTS ARE NOT BARE. Both need standing a real user would have earned, or the flows
fail on gates that are working correctly:
  · the owner needs `adopter` + a verified phone, because the adoption inquiry is gated on
    Verified Member and a verified number (US-A3/A4). A bare account is refused, and that
    refusal is right — the fixture is what has to change;
  · the shelter needs a `shelter_profile` row, or the shelter shell has nothing to render.

⚠️ LOGIN IS RATE-LIMITED AND FRESH FIXTURES DO NOT HELP — verified the hard way. The endpoint
carries BOTH `LoginIpThrottle` and `LoginIdentifierThrottle` (common/throttles.py), so a burst
of local runs trips the IP limit and every account from this machine is refused, new ones
included. Rotating passwords here does nothing for it either. HTTP 429 with ~30 minutes to
wait is the backend working exactly as designed; space the runs out, which is also how the
pre-release job uses them.
