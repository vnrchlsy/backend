"""US-B1 · badge awarding + impact aggregation.

D-S6-3: badges are event-awarded and sweep-reconciled, never counted in a column. Awarding is
an idempotent insert (uq_account_badge absorbs replays), so `award_badges_for` runs both at the
qualifying event and in the nightly catch-up sweep without ever double-awarding. Impact stats
are aggregated on read from the existing tables (§6.6) — no counters stored.

D-S6-5: `badge_earned` is in-app only (push:false). A badge is a celebration, not something to
buzz a phone for — pushing it would cheapen push for a match or a pledge.

D-S6-2: criteria are shift-agnostic — any completed Kawang-Gawa shift counts, not walks only.
